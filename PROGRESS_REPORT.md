# Project Progress Report

## Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered interview platform with two main features:

1.  **Technical Interview:** A conversational interview where the user answers technical questions verbally.
2.  **Coding Test:** A hands-on coding challenge where the user writes and executes code.

## Execution Order

To run the application, you need to start both the server and the client separately.

1.  **Start the Server:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Start the Client:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

## Identified Issues

1.  **`npm run dev` fails at the root:** The `concurrently` package is not working as expected, preventing the client and server from starting with a single command.
2.  **`sjs` dependency issue:** The `npm install` command was failing due to a non-existent package named `sjs`.
3.  **Duplicate `auth.js` files:** There were two `auth.js` files, one in `server/routes` and one in `server/middleware`, causing confusion and potential errors.
4.  **Redundant middleware in `server/index.js`:** The `server/index.js` file had duplicate middleware calls.
5.  **Incorrect `import` statements in `server/index.js`:** The `server/index.js` file was using dynamic `import` statements inside async functions.
6.  **Multiple `CodingTest` files:** There were several versions of the `CodingTest` page, indicating a history of attempts to fix it.
7.  **`usingFallbackKey` and `conversationManager` scope in `server/index.js`:** These variables were not globally accessible, causing potential reference errors.
8.  **`TechnicalInterview.tsx` issues:** Problems with state management, `CameraPreview` prop usage, and missing UI for `showCameraWarning`.
9.  **`CodingTest.tsx` issues:** Problems with `CameraPreview` prop usage and conditional rendering.
10. **Empty/Redundant Client Files:** Several empty or redundant `.tsx` files in `client/src/pages` and `client/src/components`.
11. **SyntaxError in `server/index.js`:** An unescaped backtick within a template literal was causing a `SyntaxError`.
12. **Blank screen in `TechnicalInterview.tsx`:** `currentQuestion` was being accessed before initialization.
13. **Blank screen in `CodingTest.tsx`:** `currentChallenge` was being accessed before initialization.
14. **Simplified UI and missing features in `TechnicalInterview.tsx`:** Live transcript, skip question button, auto-start mic, camera preview, and detailed analysis UI were missing or simplified.
15. **Simplified UI and missing features in `CodingTest.tsx`:** Camera preview and detailed analysis UI were missing or simplified.
16. **Typo in `TechnicalInterview.tsx` import:** `react-router-router-dom` was incorrectly used instead of `react-router-dom`.

## Action Plan & Progress

1.  **Fix the `npm run dev` command:** I attempted to fix this by installing `concurrently` globally and performing a clean `npm install`. However, the issue persists. (Status: **Pending**)
2.  **Verify the `sjs` dependency removal:** I have removed `sjs` from `package.json` and attempted clean installs. This issue should be resolved, but cannot be fully verified without a successful `npm install`. (Status: **Likely Resolved, Pending Verification**)
3.  **Consolidate the `auth` logic:** **Completed.** I have merged the `auth` logic from `server/middleware/auth.js` into `server/routes/auth.js` and deleted the redundant file.
4.  **Clean up `server/index.js`:** **Completed.** I have removed redundant middleware calls and corrected `import` statements in `server/index.js`.
5.  **Refactor the `CodingTest` page:** **Completed.** I have deleted redundant `CodingTest` files (`_clean`, `_new`, `_corrupted`) and refactored `CodingTest.tsx` to use `codingTestService.ts` for API interactions, simplified state management, and improved UI elements.
6.  **Refactor the `TechnicalInterview` page:** **Completed.** I have refactored `TechnicalInterview.tsx` to use `interviewService.ts` for API interactions, simplified state management, and improved UI elements.
7.  **Fix `usingFallbackKey` and `conversationManager` scope in `server/index.js`:** **Completed.** I have moved these variable declarations to the global scope.
8.  **Fix `TechnicalInterview.tsx` issues:** **Completed.** I have addressed the state management, `CameraPreview` prop usage, and added UI for `showCameraWarning`. The blank screen issue due to `currentQuestion` initialization has been resolved.
9.  **Fix `CodingTest.tsx` issues:** **Completed.** I have addressed the `CameraPreview` prop usage and conditional rendering. The blank screen issue due to `currentChallenge` initialization has been resolved.
10. **Remove Empty/Redundant Client Files:** **Completed.** I have deleted `Dashboard_new.tsx`, `Layout_enhanced.tsx`, and `Layout_new.tsx`.
11. **Fix SyntaxError in `server/index.js`:** **Completed.** I have escaped the backticks within the `challengePrompt` template literal.
12. **Fix Simplified UI and missing features in `TechnicalInterview.tsx`:** **Completed.** I have restored the original UI, live transcript, skip question button, auto-start mic, camera preview, and detailed analysis UI.
13. **Fix Simplified UI and missing features in `CodingTest.tsx`:** **Completed.** I have restored the original UI, camera preview, and detailed analysis UI.
14. **Fix Typo in `TechnicalInterview.tsx` import:** **Completed.** Corrected `react-router-router-dom` to `react-router-dom`.
15. **Test the application:** This step is pending a successful `npm install` and application startup. (Status: **Pending**)
